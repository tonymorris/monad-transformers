Monad Transformers
==================

What are monad transformers? Why would I use them? Why do they exist? Why do monads get transformers, but others do not?

In this talk, we will first revisit [monads](http://tmorris.net/posts/what-does-monad-mean/), then take the necessary steps to re-discover why monad transformers have come to exist and in what situations they might be used. As with all things monads, a bit of mythbusting will be necessary too. After this talk, you should be equipped to explain the reason monad transformers are a useful tool, applicable to many every-day programming situations.
